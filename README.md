# Platform 50
A Roguelike game focused around Mechs known as Walkers.  You have to leave your Walker in order to pickup/install anything.  And you can either move up or move down using service elevators.  The direction you choose effects the rules of the game.  Platform 50 has two doors on each side of the room.  The doors lead to identical rooms.  Platform 50 will most likely be the only static map in the game where as we move up or down we will find procedurally generated levels.  

This will be created using Python and tcod mostly.  I'm only in the 'proof of concept' stage for most of this but I do plan on pushing code through very soon.
