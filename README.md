# Platform 50
A Roguelike game focused around Mechs known as Walkers.  You have to leave your Walker in order to pickup/install anything.  And you can either move up or move down using service elevators.  The direction you choose effects the rules of the game.  Platform 50 has two doors on each side of the room.  The doors lead to identical rooms.  Platform 50 will most likely be the only static map in the game where as we move up or down we will find procedurally generated levels.

This will be created using Python and tcod mostly.  I'm only in the 'proof of concept' stage for most of this but I do plan on pushing code through very soon.

Well.  Everything worked exactly like I hoped it would and I'm able to render and take control of a Mech-like thing that I'm calling Walkers using only ASCII.  I'm getting ready to put all the 'walkers' code into its own module and then very soon I'll start working on being able to enter and exit the Walker on the fly.  I need to take a step back from the code and actually put down some real 'strategies' instead of just winging it as I go forward.  To be honest I thought it would take longer to even get this working so yea... pretty cool stuff.  I think might actually work.  And be fun too!!!!

I'm on the final stretch to get a basic working version of stepping up to Walker and then activating it to get in.  The Walker will spring to life and allow your '@' to jump on board and start pioliting it.  I've done all the proof of concepts so I know everything is possible.  Just need to do the work now.  Hopefully by tomorrow I'll have something to show and I can post a little demo on Reddit and let people check it out themselves if they wanna play around with it.
